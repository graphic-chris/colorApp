Color Keeper App
====================

The color keeper app lets you store a collection of “color schemes” to your device. Each color scheme is a library of up to 5 color swatches. New schemes are made by using color sliders, or colors pulled from photos to create new swatches, and each swatch in any library can be edited later.

# Getting it running

1. Clone the repository onto your local machine
2. Change directory into "colorApp"
3. Install dependencies with NPM:
```npm install```
4. Install frontend dependencies with Bower:
```bower install```
4. Start serving Ionic in a browser:
```ionic start```
5. OR: emulate with an installed emulator:
```ionic emulate```
